    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts</li>
      <li>2 Tbsp. taco seasoning</li>
      <li>2 Tbsp. chili powder</li>
      <li>1/4 c. olive oil</li>
      <li>Kosher salt, to taste</li>
      <li>1 (8-oz.) can tomato sauce</li>
      <li>2 c. hot water</li>
      <li>Several dashes hot sauce</li>
      <li>Good tortilla chips</li>
      <li>Cheddar jack cheese, freshly grated</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Sprinkle both sides of the chicken breasts with the taco seasoning and
        chili powder. Rub in the seasonings as much as you can.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat the oil in a heavy skillet over medium heat. Cook the chicken
        breasts on both sides until deep golden and totally done in the middle,
        about 4 minutes per side. Remove from the skillet and let rest for a few
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the same skillet, whisk in the tomato sauce, hot water, and several
        dashes of hot sauce and bring to a gentle boil. Reduce the heat to low
        and keep warm. Taste and adjust the seasonings (you may need to add a
        little salt, depending on the taco seasoning you use).
      </li>
      <li>
        Shred the chicken using two forks, then transfer the shredded chicken to
        the sauce. Toss to coat it in the sauce. If the sauce is too thick, add
        a little more hot water and allow to simmer for a few minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        To build the nachos, layer the chips, cheese, and shredded chicken on a
        heat-proof dish in several layers, ending with a small layer on top.
        Microwave the dish (or place it in a 350ÂºF oven if oven-proof) until the
        cheese is totally melted.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve as is or add whatever extras you'd like! Dive into it immediately.
